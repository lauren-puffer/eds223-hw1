# Correlation Between Demographic Indices of Socioeconomic Status and Air Quality

# Background
This repository us data from the EJ Screen website and shape files from Census tracts held within the 'tigris' package to examine the relationship between residents of lower socioeconomic status and the air pollution. We use the 'demographic index' data from the EJ Screener tool as a proxy for socioeconomic status. This index is an aggregated score for poverty and minority status within the EJ Screener tool. It ranges from 0-12, with 12 being those residents who are more disparaged than those with lower demographic indices. PM 2.5 is used as a proxy for air pollution. PM 2.5 is any particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter. PM 2.5 can be a very big problem in areas with concentrated agricultural lands, like San Joaquin County. It can cause damage to the lungs, eyes, and nose, and cause respiratory problems and even cancer in extreme cases. We will examine whether those of lower socioeconomic status experience elevated levels of PM 2.5 in San Joaquin County California.
